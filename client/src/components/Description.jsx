            Coven Cards is a turn-based card-matching game set in a world of mythical
            creatures, wizards, and witches. You and your opponent are two spell-casters
            competing against each other in a potion-making contestâ€”gathering as many
            ingredients as you can for your respective concoctions. Every card match is
            an ingredient obtained and added to the pot, so  players must match as many
            cards as they can!
